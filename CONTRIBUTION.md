# Contribution Guide

How to work with the project:
1) View a list of current tasks and find a task which is not assigned to anyone. If the task hangs for someone too long, it is worthwhile to clarify whether the person plans to do it or fix it for himself.
2) Create a new branch in the format: mas/{feature or bug}/{#issue number} -short-description
3) When you are working with a problem, write commits in the format:  
{Feature or bug} {#issue number}: Summary of Changes  
Atomic changes are recommended.
4) After finishing work on the problem, you need to make the PR of your branch with the master branch.  

Merge with the current state lies with the person who does the PR. When adding problems, use labels. If the problem is not started by the project maintainer, then it is mandatory to put the label `unconfirmed`.
